\item{dates}{Vector of dates in a date format}

\item{out.list}{Vector of outlier dates in a date format}

Creates a matrix with additive outlier variables. Uses the original data dates and the user specified outlier dates.
}
\examples{

# create a sequence of dates
dates <- seq.Date(from = as.Date("2023-01-02"), by = "weeks", length.out = 100)
# create a vector of outlier dates
my_ao_dates <- as.Date(c("2023-01-02", "2023-01-03"))
# create a matrix of AO variables
my_ao(dates = dates, out.list = my_ao_dates)
# as you can see there is only one column corresponding to 2023-01-02,
# the second date is ignored because it is not present in the dates vector
